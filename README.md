## ü§ñ The Power of Swarm Intelligence

### What Makes Our Swarm Special?

Thrivix leverages **Strands SDK's multi-agent orchestration** to create truly collaborative AI teams. This isn't just multiple chatbots - it's a coordinated team of specialists that:

1. **Understand Context**: Each agent sees what others have done
2. **Hand Off Tasks**: Agents automatically delegate to specialists
3. **Share Knowledge**: Common memory across the swarm
4. **Work in Parallel**: Multiple agents can work simultaneously

### Our Specialized Agents

#### üîç **Research Agent**
```python
"Your role is to:
- Gather information from various sources
- Analyze requirements and context
- Use web search tools to find current information
- Share findings with the team"
```
**Tools**: Web search, Document analysis
**Handoff**: ‚Üí Architect (when research complete)

#### üèóÔ∏è **Architect Agent**
```python
"Your role is to:
- Design system architecture
- Create technical specifications
- Define interfaces and data models
- Plan implementation approach"
```
**Tools**: Diagramming, Schema design
**Handoff**: ‚Üí Coder (when design ready)

#### üíª **Coder Agent**
```python
"Your role is to:
- Implement solutions based on designs
- Write clean, efficient code
- Create necessary files and modules
- Follow best practices"
```
**Tools**: Code interpreter, File operations
**Handoff**: ‚Üí Reviewer (when code complete)

#### ‚úÖ **Reviewer Agent**
```python
"Your role is to:
- Review code for quality
- Suggest improvements
- Verify requirements are met
- Ensure best practices"
```
**Tools**: Code analysis, Testing tools
**Handoff**: ‚Üí Analyst (for metrics) or Complete

#### üìä **Analyst Agent**
```python
"Your role is to:
- Analyze data and patterns
- Create visualizations
- Perform statistical analysis
- Extract insights"
```
**Tools**: Data analysis, Visualization
**Handoff**: ‚Üí Any agent needing analysis

### Real Example: "Build a Todo App"

When you ask the swarm to "Build a todo app", here's what happens:

1. **Research Agent** investigates best practices, UI patterns, frameworks
2. **Architect Agent** designs the component structure, data flow
3. **Coder Agent** implements the HTML/CSS/JavaScript
4. **Reviewer Agent** checks code quality, suggests improvements
5. **You receive**: Complete, working code with explanations

All of this happens with full visibility - you see each agent's work, decisions, and handoffs in real-time!

## üé≠ Orchestrator - Visual Workflow Builder

The Orchestrator (`/orchestrator`) lets you:
- **Define Complex Workflows**: Create multi-step processes with conditional logic
- **Visual DAG Execution**: See your workflow as a directed graph
- **Agent Coordination**: Assign different agents to different steps
- **Approval Gates**: Add human checkpoints in automated workflows

Example workflows:
- "Research ‚Üí Analyze ‚Üí Report ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Publish"
- "Code ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy ‚Üí Monitor"
- "Data Collection ‚Üí Processing ‚Üí ML Training ‚Üí Evaluation"

## üí° How Strands Powers Thrivix

Thrivix leverages [Strands SDK 1.0](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/introducing-strands-agents-1-0-production-ready-multi-agent-orchestration-made-simple/)'s production-ready features:

### Multi-Agent Primitives We Use:
- **Swarms**: Self-organizing teams with shared memory
- **Handoffs**: Automatic task delegation between specialists  
- **Graphs**: Explicit workflows with conditional routing
- **Tools as Agents**: Agents can spawn sub-agents dynamically

### The Strands Advantage:
```python
# Simple swarm creation with Strands
from strands.multiagent import Swarm

swarm = Swarm(
    agents=[researcher, architect, coder, reviewer],
    shared_memory=True,
    auto_handoff=True
)

result = await swarm.execute("Build a todo app")
# Agents automatically coordinate and hand off tasks!
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

### What We Actually Use:
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Strands SDK
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Radix UI
- **AI Models**: OpenAI GPT-4, Claude (via API)
- **Search**: Tavily API
- **Streaming**: Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- **Sessions**: File-based persistence

## üìù API Endpoints

```bash
# Start conversation
POST /api/v1/conversation/start
{
  "message": "Your question",
  "mode": "deep"  # or "fast", "scholar"
}

# Execute swarm task
POST /api/v1/swarm/execute
{
  "task": "Build a REST API for user management",
  "agents": ["researcher", "architect", "coder", "reviewer"]
}

# Create orchestrated workflow
POST /api/v1/orchestrator/create
{
  "workflow": "research_and_report",
  "steps": ["research", "analyze", "write", "review"]
}
```

## üêõ Known Limitations

- Deep research can take 10-30 seconds
- Web search requires Tavily API key
- Some features require OpenAI GPT-4 access
- Session storage is file-based (not distributed)
