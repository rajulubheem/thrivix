# Thrivix - GitHub Deployment Guide

## Repository Setup

Your Thrivix project is now ready for deployment to GitHub. Follow these steps:

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/rajulubheem
2. Click "New" to create a new repository
3. Name it: `thrivix`
4. Description: "AI-Powered Multi-Agent Intelligence Platform"
5. Set as Public (for open source)
6. DO NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have them)
7. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Push to GitHub

After creating the empty repository on GitHub, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
cd /Users/bheemarajulu/project_wksp/thrivix

# Add GitHub remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/rajulubheem/thrivix.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Set Up GitHub Pages (Optional)

To host documentation:

1. Go to Settings → Pages in your GitHub repository
2. Source: Deploy from a branch
3. Branch: main, folder: /docs (if you add documentation)
4. Save

### 4. Add Topics and Description

In your GitHub repository:

1. Click the gear icon next to "About"
2. Add topics: `ai`, `multi-agent`, `research`, `chatbot`, `react`, `fastapi`, `gpt-4`, `openai`
3. Add website (if deployed)
4. Save changes

### 5. Create Release

1. Go to Releases → Create a new release
2. Tag version: `v1.0.0`
3. Release title: "Thrivix v1.0.0 - Initial Release"
4. Describe the release:
   - Major features

   - Known issues (if any)
5. Publish release

## Project Structure

```
thrivix/
├── frontend/          # React TypeScript frontend
├── backend/           # FastAPI Python backend
├── .gitignore        # Git ignore rules
├── LICENSE           # Apache 2.0 license
├── README.md         # Main documentation

```

## Environment Setup for Contributors

Contributors need to:

1. Copy environment templates:
```bash
cp backend/.env.template backend/.env
cp frontend/.env.template frontend/.env
```

2. Add their API keys to the `.env` files

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

## Continuous Integration (Optional)

Add GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD:

Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test-backend:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.9'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        cd backend
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        cd backend
        pytest

  test-frontend:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Setup Node
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '18'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        cd frontend
        npm ci
    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        cd frontend
        npm test -- --watchAll=false
```

## Security Considerations

Before making public:

1. **Double-check** no API keys or secrets are committed
2. **Review** all configuration files
3. **Scan** with git-secrets or similar tools
4. **Add** security policy (SECURITY.md)

## Community Guidelines

Consider adding:

1. **CONTRIBUTING.md** - Contribution guidelines
2. **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md** - Community standards
3. **Issue templates** - Bug reports, feature requests
4. **Pull request template** - PR guidelines
