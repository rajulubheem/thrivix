# Tool Visibility Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement
The user reported that when agents use tools (especially file_write), the tool usage and file contents were not visible in the chat UI. The user explicitly stated: "Agents are using the tools, but when they write the data to the file, or its code is not visible on the chat UI. It is suppose to show all the stuff it is doing. Not hiding it."

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Tool Display Service** (`backend/app/services/tool_display_service.py`)
Created a comprehensive service to format tool calls and results for clear display in the UI:
- **Before execution**: Shows tool name, parameters, and what the tool is about to do
- **After execution**: Shows results, file contents, and success/failure status
- **Special handling for file_write**: Displays full file content with syntax highlighting
- **Artifact support**: Automatically sends file contents as artifacts to the UI
- **Simulated badge**: Visual indicator when tools return simulated results

### 2. **Iterative Agent Service Integration** (`backend/app/services/iterative_agent_service.py`)
Enhanced the tool execution flow to use the display service:
- Added tool display BEFORE execution (line 621-627)
- Added tool display AFTER execution with results (line 642-649)
- Passes agent name to maintain context
- Removed old display logic in favor of centralized service

### 3. **Frontend Polling System** (`frontend/src/hooks/useStreamingPolling.ts`)
Extended the polling system to handle artifact events:
- Added `onArtifact` callback for single artifacts
- Added `onArtifactsCreated` callback for multiple artifacts
- Handles artifact events in the polling loop (lines 226-238)

### 4. **SwarmChat Component** (`frontend/src/pages/SwarmChat.tsx`)
Connected artifact handlers to the UI:
- Added artifact event handlers in streaming hook (lines 874-888)
- Automatically creates artifacts when agents write files
- Displays artifacts in the right panel

### 5. **Backend Streaming Endpoint** (`backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/streaming.py`)
Added artifact event types to the streaming system:
- Handles "artifact" events for single artifacts (lines 450-457)
- Handles "artifacts_created" events for multiple artifacts (lines 459-466)

## Key Features Implemented

### Tool Call Visibility
```markdown
### üìù Writing File: `example.py`

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

**Parameters:**
- Path: `example.py`
- Size: 45 characters
```

### Tool Result Display
```markdown
### ‚úÖ File Written Successfully

**File:** `example.py`
**Status:** Created/Updated
```

### Artifact Creation
When file_write is used, the system automatically:
1. Shows the file content in the chat
2. Creates an artifact in the artifacts panel
3. Applies proper syntax highlighting
4. Tracks file metadata (size, lines, etc.)

## Benefits

1. **Full Transparency**: Users can now see exactly what tools are doing
2. **File Content Visibility**: File contents are displayed immediately when written
3. **Artifact Integration**: Files are automatically added to the artifacts panel
4. **Simulated Indicators**: Clear visual indication when tools return simulated data
5. **Better Debugging**: Developers can see tool parameters and results

## Testing the Fix

To test the enhanced tool visibility:

1. Start a conversation with agents
2. Ask them to write a file (e.g., "Create a Python script that prints hello world")
3. Observe:
   - Tool call with parameters appears before execution
   - File content is displayed in the chat
   - Artifact appears in the right panel
   - Tool result shows success/failure

## Files Modified

1. `/backend/app/services/tool_display_service.py` - Created
2. `/backend/app/services/iterative_agent_service.py` - Modified (lines 14, 621-649)
3. `/frontend/src/hooks/useStreamingPolling.ts` - Modified (lines 13-14, 226-238)
4. `/frontend/src/pages/SwarmChat.tsx` - Modified (lines 874-888)
5. `/backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/streaming.py` - Modified (lines 450-466)

## Impact

This fix directly addresses the user's complaint about tool visibility. Now when agents use tools:
- The tool usage is clearly displayed with parameters
- File contents are shown immediately
- Artifacts are created automatically
- All tool operations are transparent to the user

The system now provides the real-time visibility that was requested, making it easier to understand what agents are doing and verify their work.
