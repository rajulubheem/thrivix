# Strands Swarm Analysis and Streaming Strategy

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ What's Working
1. **True Swarm Implementation**: Successfully created a Strands native Swarm that:
   - Uses autonomous agent collaboration
   - Implements handoff mechanisms between agents
   - Maintains shared context across agents
   - Executes tasks with specialized agents

2. **Key Features Implemented**:
   - Dynamic agent creation based on task requirements
   - Tool injection for agents (tavily_search, file operations, python_repl)
   - Configurable handoff limits and timeouts
   - Proper error handling and result extraction

### üîç How Strands Swarm Actually Works

The Strands Swarm is a **true swarm implementation** with these characteristics:

1. **Autonomous Coordination**: 
   - Agents decide independently when to hand off to other agents
   - No central controller dictating the flow
   - Uses `handoff_to_agent` tool injected by Strands

2. **Shared Context**:
   - All agents have access to the full task context
   - Can see the history of which agents have worked
   - Access shared knowledge contributed by other agents

3. **Emergent Behavior**:
   - The solution emerges from agent interactions
   - Not a pre-defined pipeline or sequence
   - Agents collaborate based on their capabilities

## Streaming Limitations and Challenges

### Current Limitations

1. **Synchronous Execution**: 
   - Strands Swarm executes synchronously in a blocking manner
   - We run it in `asyncio.to_thread()` to avoid blocking the event loop
   - No native streaming support in the library

2. **Limited Visibility**:
   - Can only access results after complete execution
   - No real-time updates during agent handoffs
   - Cannot intercept intermediate agent communications

3. **Logging vs Streaming**:
   - We can capture DEBUG logs but they're not structured for UI
   - Log messages are technical, not user-friendly
   - No built-in hooks for streaming events

### What We Can Capture

From our testing, we can capture:
```python
DEBUG | strands.multiagent.swarm | current_node=<calculator>, iteration=<1> | executing node
DEBUG | strands.multiagent.swarm | node=<calculator> | node execution completed
```

But these are:
- Not real-time (buffered logging)
- Not structured for UI consumption
- Missing agent thoughts and reasoning

## Proposed Streaming Solution

### Option 1: Custom Agent Wrapper (Recommended)

Create a streaming-aware agent wrapper that intercepts agent communications:

```python
class StreamingAgent(Agent):
    def __init__(self, base_agent, stream_callback):
        self.base_agent = base_agent
        self.stream_callback = stream_callback
        
    async def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        # Capture and stream the input
        await self.stream_callback({
            "type": "agent_thinking",
            "agent": self.name,
            "input": args[0] if args else kwargs
        })
        
        # Execute the base agent
        result = await self.base_agent(*args, **kwargs)
        
        # Stream the output
        await self.stream_callback({
            "type": "agent_response",
            "agent": self.name,
            "output": result
        })
        
        return result
```

### Option 2: Custom Swarm Implementation

Build our own swarm orchestrator on top of Strands agents:

```python
class StreamingSwarm:
    def __init__(self, agents, stream_callback):
        self.agents = {a.name: a for a in agents}
        self.stream_callback = stream_callback
        self.context = SharedContext()
        
    async def execute(self, task):
        current_agent = self.select_initial_agent(task)
        
        while not self.is_complete():
            # Stream agent selection
            await self.stream_callback({
                "type": "agent_selected",
                "agent": current_agent.name
            })
            
            # Execute agent with streaming
            result = await current_agent.execute_with_streaming(
                task, 
                self.context,
                self.stream_callback
            )
            
            # Handle handoffs
            if result.handoff_to:
                await self.stream_callback({
                    "type": "handoff",
                    "from": current_agent.name,
                    "to": result.handoff_to
                })
                current_agent = self.agents[result.handoff_to]
```

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach

Use Strands Swarm for orchestration but add streaming at tool level:

```python
def create_streaming_tool(tool_func, agent_name, callback):
    async def streaming_wrapper(**kwargs):
        # Stream tool invocation
        await callback({
            "type": "tool_call",
            "agent": agent_name,
            "tool": tool_func.__name__,
            "params": kwargs
        })
        
        # Execute tool
        result = await tool_func(**kwargs)
        
        # Stream result
        await callback({
            "type": "tool_result",
            "agent": agent_name,
            "tool": tool_func.__name__,
            "result": result
        })
        
        return result
    
    return streaming_wrapper
```

## Implementation Recommendation

### Phase 1: Tool-Level Streaming (Quick Win)
1. Wrap all tools with streaming callbacks
2. Stream tool invocations and results
3. Provides immediate visibility into agent actions

### Phase 2: Agent Communication Streaming
1. Create custom Agent wrapper
2. Intercept and stream agent-to-agent communications
3. Stream handoff decisions and reasoning

### Phase 3: Full Custom Swarm (If Needed)
1. Build custom orchestrator with full streaming
2. Maintain Strands agent compatibility
3. Add features like:
   - Parallel agent execution
   - Real-time context updates
   - Interactive agent guidance

## Comparison with Current "Swarm"

| Feature | Current Enhanced Swarm | True Strands Swarm |
|---------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Architecture | Sequential Pipeline | Autonomous Collaboration |
| Agent Communication | Previous work passing | Shared context + Handoffs |
| Execution | Sequential, one at a time | Self-organizing |
| Streaming | Full support | Limited/None |
| Control | Centralized orchestrator | Decentralized |
| Emergent Behavior | No | Yes |
| True Swarm? | No | Yes |

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Tool-Level Streaming** (1-2 hours)
   - Quick win for visibility
   - Works with existing Strands Swarm

2. **Create Agent Wrapper** (2-3 hours)
   - More comprehensive streaming
   - Maintains Strands compatibility

3. **Build Custom Orchestrator** (4-6 hours)
   - Full control over streaming
   - Can add parallel execution
   - Interactive features

## Code Example: Minimal Streaming Implementation

```python
class StreamingSwarmService:
    async def execute_with_streaming(self, task, stream_callback):
        # Create agents with streaming tools
        agents = []
        for config in agent_configs:
            tools = []
            for tool_name in config['tools']:
                tool = self.get_tool(tool_name)
                streaming_tool = self.wrap_with_streaming(
                    tool, 
                    config['name'],
                    stream_callback
                )
                tools.append(streaming_tool)
            
            agent = Agent(
                name=config['name'],
                tools=tools,
                system_prompt=config['prompt']
            )
            agents.append(agent)
        
        # Create swarm
        swarm = Swarm(agents, max_handoffs=10)
        
        # Execute in thread with periodic status updates
        import threading
        result_container = {}
        
        def run_swarm():
            result_container['result'] = swarm(task)
        
        thread = threading.Thread(target=run_swarm)
        thread.start()
        
        # Stream status while running
        while thread.is_alive():
            await stream_callback({
                "type": "heartbeat",
                "status": "running"
            })
            await asyncio.sleep(0.5)
        
        thread.join()
        return result_container['result']
```

## Conclusion

The Strands Swarm is a **true swarm implementation** with autonomous agent collaboration, but it lacks native streaming support. We can add streaming through:

1. **Tool-level wrapping** (easiest, immediate visibility)
2. **Agent wrapping** (moderate complexity, good visibility)
3. **Custom orchestrator** (most complex, full control)

The recommended approach is to start with tool-level streaming for immediate benefits, then progressively add more sophisticated streaming as needed.
